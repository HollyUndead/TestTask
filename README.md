All work on JSON files, if needed i can learn how to work with another database.
I realise all featurs up to middle level, except saves order in database, because i overestimated my abilities. I know how to write to json file with node.js, but i can't understand how i can set up web-app to do this. I spen all day on it and still don't get it.
